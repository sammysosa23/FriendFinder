### Overview 

"Friend Finder" is a full-stack site that will take in results from your users' survey. The survey has 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 - 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question,
then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The application is implemented using Node.js and Express server on the back end.
